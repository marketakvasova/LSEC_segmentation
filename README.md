# LSEC_segmentation

This repository includes Jupyter Notebooks for Google Colab. 
These notebooks are intended for automatic segmentation of fenestrations in LSECs.

This repository includes two notebooks, one creating segmentation masks of fenestrations: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/marketakvasova/LSEC_segmentation/blob/main/automatic_image_segmentation.ipynb),
and one for creating masks of whole cells: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/marketakvasova/LSEC_segmentation/blob/main/semiautomatic_cell_segmentation.ipynb).
(The second Notebook gives the option to remove some segmented fenestrations that we are not interested in).
